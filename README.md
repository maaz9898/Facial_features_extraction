## Installation of the Package manager and IDE

Anaconda is the package manager for python. The distribution comes with the Python interpreter and various packages related to machine learning and data science.
Basically, the idea behind Anaconda is to make it easy for people interested in those fields to install all (or most) of the packages needed with a single installation. 

1. Install Anaconda (Python 3.7) on your operating system. You can either download anaconda from the official site and install it on your own or you can follow these anaconda installation tutorials below.

## How to run this project
This project contains two files.
1. Test segmentation 2.ipynb
You can run this in google colab notebook its basic section base block base file which contains individual code execution processes.
Just go to the repository or go to the project folder and open this file and you will see the google colab link where you can execute the file.

2. face_segmentation.py
To run this you could put this complete code in google colab to save your time.
In Google Colab cloud
```bash
  !python Facial_features_extraction.py -input test2.jpg 
```
Or open face_segmentation.py file in CLI as mentioned below.
In local machine
```bash
  python Facial_features_extraction.py -input test2.jpg 
```
There is Test_data folder where testing images are available.
-input argument takes the image directory.
-output argument takes the output of the image directory.
Facial_features_extraction.py will generate json file like, facial_features.json
if input image has two faces or many facial features, so Facial_features_extraction.py will extract the faciall features and store into json file.
